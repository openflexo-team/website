# Cyber Threat Application
Problem: Cybersecurity of cyber physical systems & internet of things is vital. Security is a continuous process that runs throughout and at times even beyond the life-cycle of a system. Traditional methods of security modeling miss this life-cycle-based dynamicity.

Contribution: We propose an open-source framework based on Pimca, a domain specific systems modeling language highlighting the attack surface during cyber threat analysis.
